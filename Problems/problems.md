#Problems and Endevors
Konami over the course of the franchises life has failed to provide a game that addresses the communities full needs in the niche. The community has made a number of attempts (more successful than Konami's) that fail to full encompass the needs of the community. Problems with the community made simulators appear to be wicked in nature.

#Questions
- Why do people like Manual or Automatic?
- Why dont the programmers get along? 
- Why is DN's staff corrupt/non responsive?
- Why cant all the non-users/admin work togeather across all the sims?
- Why cant we educate each other>
- Why are we not tolerant of each other?
- Why doesnt the YGOPro system sopport both TCG and OCG
- What are the development cycles of each sim, and why.
- Why is Konami not taking legal action, and when it does why is it only minor

#Hypothesis (Primary)
###Why do people like Manual or Automatic?
In manual its easy to avoid misclicks, you can take back stuff, people want to cheat. Automatic may be poorly coded for certain situations. Manual is more flexiable for devided nonsensical rulings. Enables elitist class thinking. Illusion of control. 

###Why dont the programmers get along?
Financial reasons, introverted personalities and prideful. Other programmers usually dont possess the skills to defy the other. Sense of ownership. Paranoia. Comp


###Why is DN's staff corrupt/non responsive?
Age of the staff is really low. No competitors. None of them have programming experience and are very threatened by developers. Backed by other established community support systems. Leader missing in action. Player base treats them poorly due to lack of service so they have an in group protective system. Secretive, ran by xenophobes. Effectively powerless and cant admit it so take anger out on player base.


###Why cant all the non-users/admin work togeather across all the sims?
Want different things. Want casual, want hardcore, some want by the book, personality disfunctions. Competition. Loyality.

#Conclusions
Problem is sociological in nature.
